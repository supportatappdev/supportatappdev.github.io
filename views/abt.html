Connectors and Cloud Services
Connect to the most popular cloud services like Facebook, Zendesk, Twilio, LinkedIn, Twitter and more through a comprehensive set of connectors that offer you pre-built API connectivity. Get up and running quickly by simply dragging and dropping connectors, or build your own custom connectors to other systems and services.

Include or Reuse Your Existing Code
 At a user interface level, you can use any type of client side technology including your own custom HTML, Javascript, CSS, or even Flash.

 Databases
Connect to any external database using ODBC/JDBC connections. This means you can combine local and external data sources without requiring complex integration projects. Connectors to other databases like CouchDB are also available for use out-of-the-box.
